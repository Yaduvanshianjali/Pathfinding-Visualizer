# Pathfinding Visualizer
A pathfinding visualizer made in Python and Pygame. This project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to learn about popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's, A* ,Bfs,Dfs and Greedy Bfs.



## Supported Algorithms
The following pathfinding algorithms are currently supported in this visualizer:

1. Depth First Search (DFS): A traversal-based algorithm that goes as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Not commonly used for pathfinding.
2. Breadth First Search (BFS): A traversal-based algorithm that explores all neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level. Guaranteed to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
3. Greedy Best First Search: A heuristic search algorithm that prioritizes visiting nodes closest to the goal. Not guaranteed to find the shortest path, but often faster.
4. A* Search: A heuristic search algorithm that combines the strengths of BFS and greedy best first search. Efficient for many types of graphs.
5. Dijkstra's Search: A shortest path algorithm that uses a priority queue to prioritize visiting nodes with the smallest known cost. Guaranteed to find the shortest path in weighted graphs.
